        <h1>About Me</h1>
        
        <section class="bio-section">
            <p>
                I'm a PhD candidate in a joint program between the University of Adelaide and the University of Copenhagen, working on understanding how species respond to global change. My research combines my passion for ecology, birds, and computational methods to tackle some of the most pressing questions in conservation biology.
            </p>

            <h2>Research Focus</h2>
            <p>
                My doctoral research uses process-based modelling to identify species traits that confer resilience in the face of climate and land-use change. Specifically, I investigate how these large-scale environmental changes have shaped European bird populations over recent decades and explore the mechanisms by which species characteristics mediate their distributional responses. By integrating ecological theory with computational approaches, I aim to predict the future persistence of bird species under scenarios of continued global change.

            <h2>Background</h2>
            <p>
                I completed my Bachelor's degree in Biology and Master's degree in Ecology and Evolution at the University of Amsterdam, where I developed a strong foundation in evolutionary biology and ecological principles. During my master's research, I became fascinated with the intersection of technology and biodiversity, which led me to explore machine learning applications in conservation—work I continued as a research assistant at the Royal Museum for Central Africa, where I collaborated on developing deep learning tools for species identification.
            </p>

            <h2>Research Interests</h2>
            <p>
                Beyond my core PhD research, I'm interested in macroecology, biogeography, species distribution modelling, and the broader implications of trait-based approaches in understanding ecological resilience. I'm also passionate about making ecological science more accessible and actionable, whether through developing user-friendly tools or communicating research to diverse audiences.
            </p>

            <h2>Outside the Lab</h2>
            <p>
                When not working on my research, I enjoy exploring natural areas, birding, and contributing to citizen science initiatives. I'm committed to interdisciplinary collaboration and believe that addressing global environmental challenges requires diverse perspectives and creative problem-solving.
