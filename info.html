        <h1>About Me</h1>
        
        <section class="bio-section">
            <p>
                I am a 48-year-old astronaut and space explorer with over two decades of experience in aerospace exploration and research. My career has taken me to the most extraordinary destination in human reach—the Moon—which I have had the profound honor of visiting not once, but twice.
            </p>

            <h2>Lunar Expeditions</h2>
            <p>
                My first lunar mission in 2019 was a transformative experience that fundamentally changed my perspective on humanity and our place in the cosmos. Walking on the lunar surface, collecting geological samples, and conducting atmospheric experiments was the culmination of years of rigorous training and preparation. The silence, the stark beauty of the barren landscape, and the distant blue dot of Earth hanging in the black sky created a moment of profound humility.
            </p>
            <p>
                My second mission to the Moon in 2023 allowed me to build upon previous research and explore new regions of the lunar surface. This time, I led a team of fellow astronauts in groundbreaking experiments that will help shape the future of long-term human habitation on the Moon.
            </p>

            <h2>Professional Background</h2>
            <p>
                My path to becoming an astronaut began with a passion for physics and space science. I completed my undergraduate degree in aerospace engineering and went on to earn advanced degrees in planetary geology and space exploration technology. After years of service in the space agency and accumulating thousands of hours in aircraft and simulators, I was selected for the astronaut corps.
            </p>

            <h2>Beyond the Moon</h2>
            <p>
                In addition to my lunar expeditions, I have participated in multiple orbital missions, contributed to the construction and maintenance of space stations, and conducted scientific research that continues to advance our understanding of space and our universe. Every mission reinforces my commitment to exploration and my belief that understanding our cosmos is essential for the future of our species.
            </p>

            <h2>Life on Earth</h2>
            <p>
                When not in space, I am passionate about sharing my experiences with the next generation of explorers and scientists. I give lectures, mentor young aerospace professionals, and advocate for continued investment in space exploration. In my downtime, I enjoy hiking in remote landscapes that remind me of the alien worlds I've visited, photography, and spending time with family and friends.
